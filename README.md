# Machine_Learning

This repository contains Machine Learning projects completed during Udacity Online courses.


### Projects

* [Creating customer segment](https://github.com/gsc974/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Creating_Customer_Segment): Analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. .
* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/gsc974/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Dog_Breeds_Classifier): Convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [Finding donors for charity](https://github.com/gsc974/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Finding_Donors_for_CharityML): Build a supervised model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
* [Prediction Boston housing prices](https://github.com/gsc974/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Predicting_Boston_Housing_prices): Evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model for house price prediction.
* [OCT Scan diagnotic - SqueezeNet](https://github.com/gsc974/Machine_Learning/tree/master/OCT_SCAN_DIAGNOSTIC_SqueezeNet): Build and evaluate SqueezeNet model to predict from an OCT scan if the patient has retina's dease or not.
